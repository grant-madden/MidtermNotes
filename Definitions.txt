Assert (What happens when it fails?):
    feed it a bullion condition and if its false it quits the program
    check -> fails -> ends
    #include <cassert>

The invarient of a class:
    The rules that dictate how the member variables of a class represent a value
    (such as a bag of items) 

value semantics:
    The value semantics of a class determines how values are copied from one
    object to another. In C++, the value semantics consists of two operations: the
    assignment operator and the copy constructor.

constant member function:
    may examine the status of its object, but it is forbidden from
    changing the object.

const reference parameters:
    the actual argument can't be changed
    used to be faster
    any use of the parameter within the
    body of the function will access the argument from the calling
    program. Changes made to the formal parameter in the body
    of the function will alter the argument.
